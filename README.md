# Tech Competition Simulation

In this repository, you find the necessary material to play the tech competition simulation.

The .xls file is the main engine of the simulation.

There is a case study accompanying the .xls file, explaining the rules of the simulation (forthcoming).

## Introduction to R and Data Science

To play the online version of the simulation in its Data Science-based version (www.quantumsimulations.app), professors may find the following **R Nanocourses** relevant: <https://warin.ca/#R_nanocourses>.

## Simulation Rules

The simulation consists of teams of 3 players: a chief financial officer, a chief production officer and a chief marketing officer. Typically, in a class of 30 students, ten teams of 3 students would be organized.

These teams would lead the strategical decisions of a computer company. These teams will have to make decisions regarding production levels and marketing levels. Production and marketing come with costs, and the chief financial officer has a say in the decisions to keep the company afloat and even generate profits.

The Tech Competition Simulation is a multiplayer simulation. The simulation can be used in Excel and is freely accessible on Github. It is comprised of two parts. The first part is the main engine where teams will play against each other in a technology-based market. The second part is organized around quizzes. These quizzes will capture the data from the first part while combining them with other contextualized data. This is the time when students will use the language R to answer the various questions. The simulation can also be played online (forthcoming). An R compiler is integrated into the online version of the game. Documentation on how to use R is also accessible on the Github repository of the simulation.
